### Developer's Notes
* The input database can be found online at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail
* For successful implementation to the sari-sari store level, the user must collect and provide their own dataset containing all the products that their store distributes.
### Future Development
* The project can be improved by adding a pane that shows the picture of the product selected. This can be achieved by collecting a repository of labelled pictures of common retail products.
